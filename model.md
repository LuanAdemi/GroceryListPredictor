# The Model
The model currently consists out of the following sub-models:

## RScanner

(Binder link coming soon)

This sub-module is responsable for retrieving the items from a reciept, the user uploaded to the webapp. There is currently no heavy development around this sub-model. We will add a short explanation soon.

## PRecommender

(Binder link coming soon)

This sub-module uses the information gained by the other sub-modules to predict the items you should buy next time you are going to a supermarket. There too is no heavy development around this sub-module at the moment.
